Thank you for giving me this opportunity to review and revise the given code!
I have implemented some changes and removed some redundant code that i have found.

* Added accessibility descriptions to all pictures
* Indented most lines of code for ease of access.
* Commented `style.css` file to optimize organization
* Commented `index.html` file to optimize organization
